# AI-Pacman Project Series

## Overview

This series of projects, inspired by the [Berkeley Pacman project](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa22/projects/proj1/), aims to delve deep into the foundations of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by utilizing the classic Pacman game. The projects focus on implementing various search algorithms and understanding agent interactions in both single-agent and multi-agent contexts. This series serves as a comprehensive practice and reference for anyone looking to explore AI in a gaming scenario.

## Module 1: Search in Pacman

### [Pacman Simulation](#Pacman-Simulation)

The first module focuses on implementing various search algorithms to help Pacman navigate its world. Implementations include Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS), Uniform-Cost Search, A* Search, and algorithms to solve complex problems like finding all corners and eating all the dots in the maze. Detailed instructions, point distributions, useful commands for testing algorithms, and submission guidelines are provided to facilitate comprehensive understanding and practical implementation.

## Module 2: Multi-Agent Pacman

### [Multi-Agent Project](#Multi-Agent-Pacman-Project)

The second module explores Pacman in a multi-agent scenario, focusing on adversarial and probabilistic search algorithms like Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Expectimax. It also entails devising evaluation functions to assess game states effectively. The structure involves sequential tasks, additional details for thorough understanding, and suggestions for approaching the project efficiently. The module emphasizes understanding and implementing algorithms to navigate and make informed decisions within a multi-agent system.
